RESTful API
###########
***************************
Overview of the RESTful API
***************************

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each of the api's URI match a document or a subset of documents. HTTP methods define actions to do on the document(s).

Theses methods are:

	* GET : 	retrieve a document or a subset of documents
	* POST : 	create a new document
	* PUT : 	update a document
	* DELETE : 	delete a document


Data format
^^^^^^^^^^^

Only JSON format is supported. You must set the Content-Type header at application/json in all requests to the server.


API responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API's responses contain the standards HTTP codes which are significant of what happened.  

	* 200 OK : 			all went successfully gone
	* 201 Created : 	a new document was created
	* 204 Deleted : 	a document was deleted
	* 400 Bad Request : the request is malformed
	* 401 Forbidden : 	document ressource is forbidden
	* 404 Not Found : 	document is not found
	* 500 Internal :	Server Error : a server internal error occurred

	
API structure
-------------

URIs
^^^^

URI are prefixed with /api/, followed by the documentâ€™s type and optionnaly by the document identifier. 

    *URIs examples*
	
    >>> /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/
	 
    >>> /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>
	
	
Playing with the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

curl-oauth is used in examples bellow to make request to the server. If you're not familiar with please take a look at https://github.com/oxys/curl-oauth
	
1. Get a document's list

	It's done by invoking the GET HTTP method on an URI like /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/
	
	*Request*
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/
	
	*Response*
	
	The server returns data as below
	
	>>> {
	    "total_rows":<Database Document's count>,
	    "offset": 0,
	    "rows":[{
	 	   Document data...
	 	   }]
	    }
	
	* total_rows is the document count of the specified type in the database, not in the response.
	* rows contains the documents, see data structure for more explanations.
	* offset is the amount of documents that are skipped when request is paginated.
	
		
2. Get document's count

	To get only the amount of documents, use
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/_count
	
	Methods allowed are GET and POST. Search query syntax can also be applied on these urls.
	
		
3. Get a document
	
	It's done by invoking the  GET HTTP method on an URI like /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>
	
	*Request*
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>/
	
	*Response*
	
	The server returns one document
	
	>>> { Document data... }

4. Create a document

	It's done by invoking the POST HTTP method on an URI like /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/
	
	*Request*
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api --json -X POST http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/  -d '{
			"an_attribute" : "a value", "another_attribute" : "another value" 
		}'
	
	

	*Response*
	
	The server returns the newly created document with some system attributes such as _id or _rev. Systems attributes are described HERE
	

5. Update a document

	It's done by invoking the PUT HTTP method on an URI like /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>
	
	*Request*
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api --json -X PUT http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/  -d '{
			"an_attribute" : "an updated value", "another_attribute" : "another value" 
		}'
	
	

	*Response*
	
	The server returns the updated document.
	
	
6. Delete a document

	It's done by invoking the DEL HTTP method on an URI like /api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>
	
	*Request*
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X DELETE http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/<DOCUMENT_ID>
		
	*Response*
	
	The server returns nothing

		}
	
	A membership document is a relation between a user and a group.
	
	
2. Get  user's groups

	If you want to list all groups for a user just query the uri stored in the "group" attribute of the user document
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/user/johndoe/groups/
	
	Server response
	
	>>> {
		  "total_rows": 1,

		    }
		  ]
		}
		
	The server will return all membership documents for the user. Observe that user attribute of the membership document is not here. 
	
	If you want in the same query fetch the group document you can do it with the special query string parameter include_docs
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/user/johndoe/groups/?include_docs=true
	
	server response
	
	>>> {
		  "total_rows": 1,

		    }
		  ]
		}

3. Get  group's users

	You can fetch the group's members by requesting on the "users" attribute of the group document

	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/groups/my-group/users/
	
	or 
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/groups/my-group/users/?include_docs=true
	
4. Update
	
	.. warning:: Update are not allowed on membership uri.
	
5. Delete

	To delete a membership relation, proceed in the same way as others documents
	
	>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api --X DELETE http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/membership/0b3bcb3a4b4fd153e2373f7ec49f5a57

Permission
^^^^^^^^^^

Permission documents are used to define access rights on documents.

A permission document is composed of two attributes:
	* grantTo which defines who has the permission. It could be a group or an user.
	* applyOn which defines the document on which the permission is applied.
	
Base permission uri varies depending on the document type and the permission type.

Permissions types are:
	* write user
	* read user
	* write group 
	* read group
	
All documents types don't have all permissions types.

1. Permissions by document types
	
	1.1 Group
		
		Group have user and group write permissions.
		
		To create a group permission



*************************************
Searches
*************************************

Documents searches are restricted to types event, agenda, group, entity and user.

Searches urls are:
	* http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/event/_search
	* http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/agenda/_search
	* http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/group/_search
	* http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/entity/_search
	* http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/user/_search	
	
Methods allowed are POST and GET.

Search query is contained in the q attribute:

	>>> q=fulltext search field1:... field2:...>
	
Field syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	To query a field that is not on top of the field hierarchy, use a single point to chain fields. For example, a document such as below
	
	>>> {
		"field1" : {"field2" : "value"}
		}
		
	can be queried with
	
	>>> q=field1.field2:value

Text searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This kind of search is applied on fulltext searches and text field searches. So searches examples below can be rewrite as:

	>>> q=field:<search sample>

1. Phrase searches
	
	A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
	
	>>> q="event title"
	

2. Wildcards searches

	Single and multiple characters wildcard search are supported. 
	
	For single character wildcard use : "?"
	
	>>> q=some?hing
		
	For multiple characters wildcard use : "*"
	
	>>> q=some*ng
		
	Wildcards can be placed at the beginning, end or in the middle of the search string.
	
	Wildcards are not useable with phrase search.
	
3. Fuzzy searches
	
	Fuzzy searches are based on the Levenshtein Distance. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Single word Term.
	
	>>> q= somethink~
	
	This search will find terms like something.
	
	Fuzzy searches are not useable inside a phrase search.
	
4. Boolean operators

	Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Operators supported are AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" (Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).
	
	You can use boolean operator to combine term and phrase query.
	
	The OR operator is the default conjuncton operator.
	
	>>> q=event title
	
	is exactly the same as
	
	>>> q=event OR title
	
	The plus operator define a term as required.
	
	>>> q=+event title
	
	means that documents MUST contain event and MAY contain title.
	
	The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT.
	
	To search document that contain "first stage" but not "second stage" use the query:
	
	>>> q="first stage" NOT "second stage"
	
	The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results:
	
	>>> q=NOT "second stage"
	
	The "-" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol.
	
	>>> q=-"second stage"
	
5. Grouping
	
	Use parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.
	
	>>> q=(second OR first) AND stage
	
	
Date searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	Date are formated as:
	
	>>> YYYY-MM-DD
	
	Datetime are formated as:
	
	>>> YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
	
1. Exact date searches

	>>> q=dateField:2011-12-31
	>>> q=dateField:2012-01-01
	
2. Date range searches

	Date range syntax is [from TO to]. The range operator "TO" must be CAPS.
	
	From and to can be a date, datetime, NOW or *.
	
	To search for documents that were created last year use this query:
	
	>>> q=createDate:[2010-01-01 TO 2010-12-31]
	
	To search for documents that were created this year use this query:
	
	>>> q=createDate:[2011-01-01 TO NOW]
	
	NOW will be replaced  by current date
	
	To search for documents that were created before now use this query:
	
	>>> q=createDate:[* TO NOW]
	
	
Boolean searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Boolean values are TRUE or FALSE. They must be CAPS.
	
	>>> q="isActive:TRUE"
	

Geographic searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	In bounding box and distance searches are supported.
	
1. In bounding box searches

	Use this query to search documents that take place in a bounding box
	
	>>> q=geoField:[TOPLEFT_LON TOPLEFT_LAT BOTTOM_RIGHT_LON BOTTOM_RIGHT_LAT]
	
2. Distance searches

	Use this query to search document that take place at 30 km from the point -0.3686 (lon), 43.3017 (lat)
	
	>>> q=geoField:[-0.3686 43.3017 DISTANCE 30km]
	
	Units supported for distance value are kilometers (km), or miles (mi)
	
Multiple searches for a same field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	To apply multiple search query on a same field, just define the query more than one
	
	>>> q=dateField:2011-12-03 dateField:2011-12-05
	
Special characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current list special characters are: + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \

To escape these character use the \ before the character.

**********
Pagination
**********
	
Pagination is done by passing extra parameters in query string or body according to http method. These parameters are from and size. 

from define the amount of documents to skip, size define the amount of documents to fetch.

For example

>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/<DOCUMENT_TYPE>/?from=10&size=5

This query will return documents from 10th to 15th 

Defaults are size=10 and from=0.

*******
Sorting
*******

Sort is done by passing a "sort" parameter in query string or body according to http method.

Sort fields depends on document types.

For event:

	* createDate
	* updateDate
	* event.title
	* event.when.startTime
	* event.when.endTime
	* distance (only if a distance query was done)
	
For agenda and group:
	* createDate
	* updateDate
	* title
	
For entity:

	* createDate
	* updateDate
	* entity.name
	* entity.firstName
	* entity.lastName
	* distance (only if a distance query was done)
	
For user:
	* createDate
	* updateDate
	* lastLogin
	* joinedDate
	* login
	* firstName
	* lastName
	
For example, to sort events by distance ascendant and start date descendant, use the query below

>>> sort=distance -event.when.startTime
	
*************
Sample usages
*************

Query that retrieve events that took place in 2010 and contain "foundation", ordered by start date, paginated by 20 documents

>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X GET 'http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/event/?from=0&size=20&q=foundation event.when.startTime:[2010-01-01 TO 2010-12-31]&sort=event.when.startTime'

or

>>> curl-oauth --domain cz-api -X POST http://api-master.czagenda.oxys.net/api/event/ -d 'from=0&size=20&q=foundation event.when.startTime:[2010-01-01 TO 2010-12-31]&sort=event.when.startTime'
